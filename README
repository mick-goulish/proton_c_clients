Both dirs also little run scripts called ... wait for it ... 'r'.

When you run the test, start the receiver first.

The sender will print out a timestamp just before it sends 
the first message.  The receiver will print out a timestamp 
just after it receives the last message.


The sender and receiver are locked onto separate processors.
( numbers 1 and 2. )


The sender and receiver memory footprints grow relatively slowly 
now, after I fixed a large dumb leak in my code.
